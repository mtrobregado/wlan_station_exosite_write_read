Need to do:

Import wlan_station_exosite_write_read to your CCS workspace. Set correct CCS Include Paths and Path Variables
as needed. If any problem doing this, ask help at TI E2E Code Composer Studio Forum. I recommend use the latest CCS 
Version.

Install CC3100 SDK, and Tivaware at your PC.


SSID_NAME, SEC_TYPE, PASSKEY should be updated as per AP details at sl_common.h. 
File Location: C:\ti\CC3100SDK_1.1.0\cc3100-sdk\examples\common\sl_common.h 

/*
 * Values for below macros shall be modified per the access-point's (AP) properties
 * SimpleLink device will connect to following AP when the application is executed
 */
#define SSID_NAME       "YOUR_SSID"          /* Access point name to connect to. */
#define SEC_TYPE        SL_SEC_TYPE_WPA      /* Security type of the Access piont */
#define PASSKEY         "YOUR_PASSWORD"      /* Password in case of secure AP */
#define PASSKEY_LEN     pal_Strlen(PASSKEY)  /* Password length in case of secure AP */

Set your CIK at exosite.c

static char cikBuffer[CIK_LENGTH] = "YOUR EXOSITE CIK HERE";
